title: Soketi: Inter-planetary Communication (2024-03-20)
---

Soketi had a long journey in which we tackled most of the problems ‚Äî in real-time, of course.
We got pretty handy on our skills to bring solutions.

## Support üòÉ

Soketi sends you a warm thank you for the support for those who kept supporting its development, even with a small amount. It allowed us to focus on Soketi's development whenever it was possible.

We vowed to keep Soketi free of charge, so we relied on Sponsorships to support the development. Struggling to find development for such an awesome project, we took some decisions and we have some plans for the future.

If you wish to support Soketi, you can do it with as little as $10 per month. This will boost our efforts to make it a top choice in the development of real-time applications.

**In return, we will display your Github profile, publicly on all Soketi pages within the Github organization and our websites. Sponsorships greater than $100 can opt-in for displaying a custom logo instead.**

## Interplanetary üöÄ‚ú®

After a lot of research, we reinforced the existing version of Soketi with technologies that are the backbone of decentralized networks. We worked into implementing IPFS-backed technologies like Helia to bring a better, Redis-free, out-of-the-box experience for anyone.

In less than a month, we plan releasing the new Soketi with brand-new features like Ably and MQTT support, one-click deployments on both managed and premise infrastructure, long term support for virtualized environments and even user-defined Serverless Functions that will help you write custom hooks without creating new servers.

## Soketi on Cloudflare Workers üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Soketi on Cloudflare Workers was a good test for infrastructure at Edge. For most of you, it was enough to run since you got small loads ‚Äî either for testing locally, or for small internal projects, or up to a few tens of concurrent connections. Some, even reached hundreds and thousands of concurrent connections thanks to the Hibernation API, which allowed up to 32,000 connections at once.

We decided to put the Cloudflare Workers version on pause, and focus on the main stage ‚Äî going Interstellar, promising to come back at it later, with a better experience.
